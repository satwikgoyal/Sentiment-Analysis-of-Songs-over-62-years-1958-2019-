# Sentiment Analysis of Songs over 62 years 1958-2019 

## Abstract
###### The aim of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on representative samples of the most popular music from the past few decades to see if there was any significant change to the sentiment (positive or negative) in the language used in popular music lyrics over time. We analyzed the Billboard Hot 100 songs through each week in every year of our dataset using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), and observed a trend of increasing negative sentiment and decreasing positive sentiment in song lyrics over the years.

## Introduction
###### This study is an attempt to analyze how popular music has changed over the years. We all have heard from our elders or peers who are fond of older music from the 80s or 90s about how music lyrics have degraded over the years and the positivity that the songs from that timeline radiated simply isnâ€™t prevalent in modern music. We hope to learn through our project exactly how much has sentiment in popular music changed (or not), and in what ways.

###### The results of this project will help us in linking societal factors or changes/evolution of music over time to the changes in sentiments that we obtain. We also feel that since the most popular songs of the year are generally a good representation of what the common public prefers to hear at that time, getting the most prevalent sentiments of popular songs in each year and their changes over the years could be useful in determining if there is a change in public sentiment over the years, i.e : if the public is getting more aggressive/negative and increasing the usage of such sentiment words or inspecting other behavioral or preferential changes that the society might have been going through.

###### In this study we have attempted to answer the following research questions: <br/> 1. How have sentiments in songs have changed over the last 62 years (1958-2019)? <br/> 2. Which model (from Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, VADER, TextBob,and Gaussian Naive Bayes) performs better in song classification (Classes: Positive & Negative)?

## Results from the study
###### 1. 2018 and 2019 had the most negative lyrics recorded in the last 62 years <br/> 2. 1979 (as per Procedure 1 and 3) and 1997 (as per Procedure 2) had the most positive lyrics recorded in the last 62 years <br/> 3. All three graphs (with different assumptions and normalizations) indicate an overall net positive polarity and suggest a general trend of the net sentiment polarity (decreasing) heading towards a more negative sentiment. <br/> 4. As seen in table 1, we can clearly see how top keywords from 1958 are usually used in a positive context to express joy, whereas top keywords from 2019 are mostly slangs, generally used in negative/offensive contexts to express anger and sorrow.
